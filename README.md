# makemore (Character-Level Language Model)

## Overview
This repository is my learning implementation of the **makemore** character-level language model, originally created and explained by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy).  
The project demonstrates:
- Bigram and trigram language models
- Simple feedforward neural networks
- Training on text datasets and generating new sequences

I have made **minor modifications** to suit my local environment (e.g., dataset path changes, variable naming adjustments).  
This project is **strictly for learning purposes** and takes full inspiration from Andrej Karpathy's original work.
